        <h1>Focaccia Panzanella</h1>
        <img src="../images/Focaccia_Panzanella.jpg">
        <p>At the height of tomato season, for every perfectly ripe, taut and juicy specimen, there’s an overripe, oozing counterpart not far away. The Tuscan bread salad called <em>Panzanella</em> is the perfect place to use those sad, soft tomatoes that are still rich in flavor. Traditional panzanella is made with stale, dried bread that’s rehydrated from a dressing of sweet tomato juices, vinegar and plenty of olive oil. This version also includes some mozzarella for richness and cucumber for crunch. It’s an ideal make-ahead dish; the longer the mixture sits (up to 6 or so hours), the better it tastes. Just make sure your bread thoroughly dries out in the oven so it won’t turn to mush.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups cubed focaccia bread</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>

            <li>1 anchovy fillet (Optional)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup red wine vinegar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 vine-ripened tomatoes, cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
