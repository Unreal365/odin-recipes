        <p>This simple baked <strong>Ratatouille</strong> is the perfect recipe for all those beautiful farmers market veggies showing up in the next month or two, and I seriously can’t wait for you to make this!  It’s so easy, it’s healthy (totally vegan!) and roasting the veggies really boosts the flavor!. The best part? You can make a big batch of Ratatouille on a Sunday, then serve it up 3 different ways during the workweek – over pasta, over polenta and over toast! A great meal prep idea!. It’s so yummy, you won’t tire of it. This version takes <strong><em>15 minutes</em></strong> of hands-on time before it goes into the oven to roast. You could even freeze this for winter!</p>
