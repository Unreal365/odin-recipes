        <p>This <strong>Runza Casserole</strong> is amazing. The crescent dough that sandwiches in the casserole on the top and bottom is slightly buttery and sweet. A nice contrast with the savory meat and cabbage mixture. It may seem like a lot of onions, but they cook down and lend such a nice flavor. We went heavy on the pepper when seasoning the ground meat and cabbage and liked the final result. What makes this special, though, is the pound of grated ooey gooey cheese. A quick and easy casserole!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped cabbage</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can low-sodium cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
